# Tuples

- an **immutable** container(i.e. data structure) for a fixed sequence of data objects.
- defined by () and a comma (,)



## Tuple immutability

>Like strings, tuples are immutable. Once Python has created a tuple in memory, it cannot be changed. But we can add and slice tuples. See example below:


## built-in tuple functions

## tuple as `return` values

## why tuples?
